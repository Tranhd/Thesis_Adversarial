## CNN for Mnist  
Functions to generate fast gradient sign method adversarials. 

## User Guide 

#### Create graphs and networks
The algorithm need a tensorflow session and a copy of it to evaluate if the adversarials are powerful enough.
```python
tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.Session()
net2 = MnistCNN(sess, save_dir='../Thesis_CNN_mnist/Mnist_save/')
tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.Session()
```
#### Create Adversarials
The adversarials is generated by providing the make_adversarials function with a tensorflow session, a copy of the target network, data, the data labels, an epsilon (parameter for fgsm), max epochs, batch size, a random seed and a optional filename for saving the adversarials.
```python
r_seed = 1337
X_adv = make_adversarials(sess, net2, x_train, y_train, eps=0.01,epochs=20, batch_size=3, seed=r_seed, filename='adv_'+str(r_seed))
```

#### Loading file
To load the file with existing adversarials
```python
X_adv = fetch_data('adv_'+str(s))
```
